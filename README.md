# Weather Prediction App

As part of the GOMYCODE program, this project showcases the integration of machine learning, data visualization, and web application development to create a user-friendly tool for temperature prediction.

## Key Highlights

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Utilized the **Open-Meteo API** to fetch detailed and up-to-date weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- Automated data retrieval processes to ensure seamless updates for model retraining and prediction accuracy.

### 2. Data Processing and Analysis
- Cleaned and preprocessed the raw weather data, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key trends and correlations, such as temperature patterns across different seasons and locations.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Development
- Designed and trained **regression models** to predict future temperatures using features like historical weather data and atmospheric conditions.
- Compared and evaluated multiple algorithms (e.g., **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**) to select the most accurate model.
- Conducted **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.

### 4. Streamlit Web Application
- Developed an interactive **Streamlit app** that allows users to input specific parameters (e.g., location, time frame) to view predicted temperatures.
- Integrated **visualizations**, including line charts and heatmaps, for an engaging user experience.
- Ensured **responsiveness** and usability by designing an intuitive layout.

### 5. Deployment and GitHub Integration
- Hosted the app locally and provided **deployment instructions** for easy access.
- Uploaded the complete project codebase, including **data preprocessing scripts**, **model training notebooks**, and the **Streamlit app**, to GitHub for collaboration and transparency.

## Learning Outcomes
This project strengthened skills in **API integration**, **machine learning**, **data visualization**, and **web app development**. It also demonstrated the ability to solve real-world problems by combining technical expertise and user-focused design.
